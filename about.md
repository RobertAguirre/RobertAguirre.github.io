Hello, my name is Robert Aguirre but you can call me â€œBobby"! I am originally from New Jersey, and after migrating south for college, I have returned home. Definitely, missing that southern weather. 
I received my degrees from the College of Charleston in South Carolina, where I majored in International Business and Business Administration. Although, if I could do it all over again I would have 
pursued a Computer Science degree. I find computers, coding, and the ability to create something from nothing fascinating. Currently, I am a sales, marketing, and business development professional 
with a strong focus on digital resources. I have always had a strong passion for computers, and not until recently have I decided to pursue that passion. I have begun my journey as a Full-Stack developer
with Bloc. I still have a ways to go, along with this site, but this is my journey. Thanks for visiting.
