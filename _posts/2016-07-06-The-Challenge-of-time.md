Time: Friend or Foe

Time, the one thing in life all us wish they had more of. Unlike science fiction, time is continuously moving forward and the fountain of youth has yet to be discovered. So for the time being, time management and leverage are essential to your productivity. 

As a new developer, time can be one the biggest challenges. It’s safe to assume most that begin their journey through a coding bootcamp can relate. Since the programs offered are so new that deferred student loans are non-existent, and those enrolled are currently employed full-time in addition to the course. Those individuals that are able to take the course full-time without the concern of finances, you are envied. For the rest of us once you factor in full-time employment, family, friends, and other responsibilities the course work can become overwhelming. Most importantly lets not forget sleep and fact that you may be coming from an entirely different field or industry with zero experience. Feeling as if there is not enough time is common, but if you manage and leverage your time correctly the results are extraordinary.
  
Consider “the rule of 168”. Everyone, without exception, is granted with the magical number of 168 each week. An explanation is in order; each of us gets 168 hours each week. Twenty-four hour days multiplied by seven days in a week. This is non-negotiable. Once you factor sleep into the equation your left with approximately 112-126 hours depending on how many hours you sleep each evening. The only solution is better time management skills and leveraging time, if your able. 

First solution. Leverage as much time as possible. Those of us financing the courses are selling our available hours and time for compensation. Our employers are leveraging our time, but you can also flip the script. If your able to be more productive in a shorter amount of time or utilize another’s services, such as someone to clean your home or walk your dog you may be able to leverage more time for yourself. Personally, family is a huge asset in this facet, and if you have available family-members that can assist with some of your responsibilities during the course, leverage that gained time efficiently. Also, and most importantly don’t forget to thank them.  

Second solution. The most renowned, do not procrastinate. Bad habits are easy to develop and even harder to break. Start by taking control of your calendar and determining where your time is most spent. Once you’ve made the determinations, prioritize the most important tasks and work to become more efficient with your available time. Attempt to do more in shorter periods, if able, and always remember to take breaks. Sometimes something as simple as walking away from your monitor for thirty minutes is all that is needed to get a fresh perspective on your work or a problem your
facing. 

In conclusion, don’t stress there is more time then you realize! Time is a friend.
