Time, the one thing in life all us wish there was more of. Unlike science fiction, time is continuously moving forward and the fountain of youth has yet to be discovered. For now, leverage and time management are essential to your productivity. 

As a new developer, time can be one the biggest challenges. It’s safe to assume most that begin their journey through a coding bootcamp can relate. The programs offered are relatively new so deferred student loans are non-existent, and those enrolled are also employed full-time in addition to the course. Those individuals that are able to take the course full-time without the concern of finances, you are envied. For the rest of us once you factor in full-time employment, responsibilities, and other facets of life the course work can become overwhelming. Most importantly, lets not forget sleep and the fact that you may be coming from an entirely different field or industry with zero experience. The belief of not having enough time is common, but if you manage and leverage your time correctly such ideologies can be avoided. 
  
Consider “The Rule of 168”. Everyone, without exception, is granted with the magical number “168” each week. An explanation is in order; each of us gets 168 hours each week. Twenty-four hour days multiplied by seven days in a week. This is non-negotiable. Once you factor sleep into the equation, dependent on hours each evening, your left with approximately 112-126 hours. To combat this limited time one must implement solutions such as leveraging potential time and better time management.

First solution. Leverage as much time as possible. Those of us financing the courses are selling our available hours for compensation. Our employers are leveraging our time, but you can also flip the script. If your able to be more productive in a shorter amount of time or utilize another’s services, such as someone to clean your home or walk your dog you may be able to leverage more time for yourself. Personally, family is a huge asset in this facet. If family-members can assist you with some of life’s numerous responsibilities during the course, leverage that gained time efficiently. Also, and most importantly don’t forget to thank them.  

Second solution. The most renowned, do not procrastinate. Bad habits are easy to develop and even harder to break. Start by taking control of your calendar and determining where your time is most spent. Once you’ve made the determinations, prioritize the most important tasks and work to become more efficient with your available time. Attempt to do more in shorter periods, if able, and always remember to take breaks. Sometimes something as simple as walking away from your monitor for thirty minutes is all that is needed to get a fresh perspective on your work or a problem your
facing. 

In conclusion, don’t stress there is more time then you realize! Time is a friend.
